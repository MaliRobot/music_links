# music_links

This is a little experiment that I work on out of curiosity. Key idea is to start with an artist from Discogs, get their releases, 
then get the artists from these releases, repeating the process for each artists. The goal is to find interesting links between 
artists. These should later come with proper front end to display these links as a graph.
